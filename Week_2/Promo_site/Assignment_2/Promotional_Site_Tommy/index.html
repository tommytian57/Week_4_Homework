		The Boeing 747 was first developed by the Boeing company to compete with the Lockheed Martin company to provide the US Air Force with a new
		transportation aircraft in 1964, but Lockheed Martin finally beat Boeing with its newly designed "C-5 Galaxy" aircraft. Boeing's engineers 
		put the design and technology of its military project into a new kind of large airplane that could carry hundreds of passengers across the
		Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean after Pan American Airlines's CEO asked for a large pasenger liner. In 1969, the first Boeing 747, AKA the
		Jumbo Jet, went off the production line and cost about 2.2 million dollars at that time. The first 747s were delivered to many large airline 
		companies who aimed to develop long-haul routes, including Pan American, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, and Trans World Airlines.

	<p id="p2">
		The peak of the Jumbo Jet came during the late 1970s until the early 2000s. The emergence of the Boeing 747 made transcontinental travels
		possible by drastically increasing the capacity of commercial airplanes, allowing more people chances of flying between the US and other
		continents all over the world. With more people traveling on aircrafts, airline companies can decrease the price per person, making more people
		able to afford even the cross-ocean tickets. Not only thr major Airlines in the US purchased the Boeing 747, Many large European airlines, including
		British Airways, Airfrance, Lufthansa, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and AItalia, all purchased the 747. Many Asian Airlines also included the 747
		in their trans-ocean routes, including Air China, Japan Airlines, ANA, Cathay Pacific, and Korean Airlines.

		As Boeing and Airbus both managed to develop two-engine long-haul airplanes like the 777 and the A330 series, Boeing 747's disadvantages also
		became transparent: with four engines, they are more fuel-confusing and cost more money to repair and maintain. As 777 became the best seller of
		the Boeing company started in the early 2000s, many airline companies chose to purchase more two-engine long-haul airplanes that are more fuel-efficient, 
		and the 747 is gradually eliminated from their fleets. However, the meaning of 747 is unforgetable in human history: it remarks the start of a new
		era, which people began to afford long-distance travel through air, which connected the world truly into an "earth village"; also, the beauty of the 
		747 is also remarkable: it is so big, so long, so slender, and so beaufitul! Long live the queen of the sky, long live the 747!
